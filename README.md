## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install tqdm
pip install scipy
```

## Usage:
```bash
python edge_tracking.py
```
- Run edge_tracking.py file to get the result:
![Example Image](Edge_tracking_result.png)
the difference in position between the blue edges from the previous frame and the
green edges predicted for the current frame signifies the manifestation of optical
flow or, in other words, "edge flow" within this algorithm.
